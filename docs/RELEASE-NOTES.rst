Limitations
```````````
* The BIG-IP Controller controls one (1) partition on the BIG-IP device.
* Controller configurations are global: they apply to all L7 (HTTP) LTM objects in the designated BIG-IP partition.
* This release supports custom policies and profiles for **L7 virtual servers** only.
* Configured health monitor objects apply to all pools (both L4 and L7 routes).
* SSL profile(s) defined in the application manifest do not attach to the HTTP virtual server.
* Modification of a Controller-owned policy resulting in a state change may cause traffic flow interruptions. If the modification changes the state to ‘published’, the Controller will delete the policy and recreate it with a ‘legacy’ status.
* You cannot change the default route domain for a partition managed by an F5 controller after the controller has deployed. To specify a new default route domain, use a different partition.
